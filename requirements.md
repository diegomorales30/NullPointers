1. Introduction
    1.1 Purpose of Product

    This software is a utility for a pet food distribution center. The 
    organization allows for low-income pet owners to recieve free pet food 
    and must manage how much food is allocated to individuals based on the 
    specifics of their pet and their need. We are creating both a database 
    to record the people who revieve food, as well as a simple UI to display, 
    change, and record the distribution to each individual.
    
    1.2 Scope of Product

    The scope is ostensibly small. We only need to record individuals and keep track 
    of ~5 data members per individual. However, the ultimate goal here is ease of use, 
    so a lot of our effort will be put into designing a smart and intuitive UI.
