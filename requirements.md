1. Introduction
    1.1 Purpose of Product
    This software is a utility for a pet food distribution center. The organization allows for low-income pet owners to recieve free pet food and must manage how much food is allocated to individuals based on the specifics of their pet and their need. We are creating both a database to record the people who revieve food, as well as a simple UI to display, change, and record the distribution to each individual.
    
    1.2 Scope of Product
    The scope is ostensibly small. We only need to record individuals and keep track of ~5 data members per individual. However, the ultimate goal here is ease of use, so a lot of our effort will be put into designing a smart and intuitive UI.
