## User Stories

### 1: Ease of Use

As a manager of a small pet food distributor, I want my team and I to have little issue using the software we are given. 

Elaboration: The software must be intuitive for a non-computer savvy person. This means it should be designed and organized in a way that I have no questions about the actions I am taking within the software. 

Constrains: Computer skill level.
Effort Estimation: 10 minutes.

### 2: Data Validation

As manager, I want to be sure that my system is going to catch all possible mistakes as I enter data so that I can be sure that when I fetch the data it is totally accurate. 

Elaboration: I should be able to freely interact with the software in the sense that I will not be able to make a critical mistake. I want to be sure that our data, when accessed, represents the truth as we have been told, so we can confidently distribute our pet food.

Constraints: none.
Effort Estimation: varies.

### 3: Security

As a manager or team member, it is vital that the information is stored in a secure manner so that we know the data was only manipulated by team members.

Elaboration: Since we offer a free service, inventory is managed with strict protocals. A recipient must prove that they are below income thresholds, and that they only recive the food 7 times a year. For this reason, we must ensure that we have a password safe system where only team members are able to change these qualifications.

Constraints: none.
Effort Estimation: varies.
    
### 4: Intuitiveness

As a person who might need to view data held within this software, but did not write data to this software, I want to clearly understand what I see.

Elaboration: I may be required to view this data when the usual person in charge is away for some reason. I want to immediately understand what each aspect of this software does, and feel totally confident in my ability to interact with the software.

Constrains: My own knowledge of computers.
Effort Estimation: 3 minutes.

### 5: Speed

As a manager, I want to quickly be able to pull up or alter the data I am presented with.

Elaboration: I don't want to waste my time or the customer's time clicking through multiple windows in order to alter a simple aspect of the user's data. For instance, if a person has spayed or neutered their pet, I would like to simple search their name and check the appropriate box.

Constraints: none.
Effort Estimation: 2 hours.

### 6: Confidence in Manipulation

As a manager, I want to be sure that I cannot make a critical error when changing data.

Elaboration: I don't want to fear that a mistake I've made will cause me to lose vital data. I want to be able to stop using pen and paper and fully trust this software to archive my data. An archive button might help with my faith in the software. 

Constraints: none
Effort Estimation: 1 hour
