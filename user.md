1: Ease of Use

As a manager of a small pet food distributor, I want my team and I to have little issue using the software we are given. 

Elaboration: The software must be intuitive for a non-computer savvy person. This means it should be designed and organized in a way that I have no questions about the actions I am taking within the software. 

Constrains: Computer skill level.

Effort Estimation: 10 minutes.


2: Data Validation

    As manager, I want to be sure that my system is going to catch all possible mistakes as I enter data so that I can be sure that when I fetch the data it is totally accurate. 

    Elaboration: I should be able to freely interact with the software in the sense that I will not be able to make a critical mistake. I want to be sure that our data, when accessed, represents the truth as we have been told, so we can confidently distribute our pet food.

    Constraints: none.

    Effor Estimation: varies.
